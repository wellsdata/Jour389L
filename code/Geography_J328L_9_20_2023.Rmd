This notebook has two parts.

The BUILDING THE DATA:
Will clean and geocode the cities and states of the newspapers. 
And then it will geocode the cities and states of the crimes.
And then it will measure:
1) Whether the newspaper was reporting on an in-state or out-of-state event
2) The distance from the newspaper's city to the city of the lynching


The ANALYSIS
--Looks at In state / out of state coverage
--Distance over time
--Southern vs other regions
